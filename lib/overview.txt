Data Layer -

- Databases, Models, Serilization/Deserialization
- Data Layer will inherit all the Abstractions
- Indirectly we are telling data layer that what kind of classes will it have
- Data layer will depend on Domain layer


Presentation Layer -

- Blocs and UI
- Depends on Domain Layer beacuse of BLOC using usecases


Domain Layer - 

- Abstractions
- Independent
- Both Presentation and Data layers depending on this layer, 
since the Data Layer will implement what ever contracts written here.. 
and the Presentation Layer will use those contracts with the implementations 
to be used as an injected dependencies.
- Keep in mind that the Presentation Layer will only get data as entities and not models


Use Cases in Domain Layer -

- getting articles, post data, signing in, â€¦etc
